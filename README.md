# Charles Darwin's Book Recommendation System

## Overview:

Explore the intellectual landscape of Charles Darwin beyond "On the Origin of Species" (1859) by diving into the breadth of his literary contributions. This project involves the creation of a content-based book recommendation system that automatically assesses the thematic closeness among Darwin's various works. Whether delving into geology, plants, or personal reflections, this system aims to unveil the interconnectedness of his writings.

## Objective:

The primary objective is to employ methodologies commonly found in text- or document-centric domains, such as legal, tech, or customer support. By doing so, we can develop a robust recommendation system capable of determining the relative proximity of Darwin's books based on shared thematic elements.

## Methods:

Utilizing techniques prevalent in tasks like text classification and search engine query handling, this project establishes a foundation for content-based book recommendation systems. The focus is on uncovering the underlying thematic similarities that bind Darwin's diverse works together.

## Dataset:

The dataset comprises various books authored by Charles Darwin, offering a comprehensive view of his intellectual pursuits beyond the iconic "On the Origin of Species." Each book serves as a unique window into Darwin's mind, covering an array of topics.

## Project Structure:

- **Data Exploration:** Examine the contents and themes of each book to understand the diversity of Darwin's literary contributions.

- **Text Processing:** Implement tokenization and other text processing techniques to prepare the data for analysis.

- **Similarity Assessment:** Employ algorithms to quantify the thematic closeness between books, laying the groundwork for the recommendation system.

- **Recommendation System Development:** Construct a content-based recommendation system that suggests books based on their thematic similarities.

## Usage:

Explore the notebooks and scripts in this repository to gain insights into the creation of the content-based book recommendation system. The documentation provides step-by-step guidance, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

Feel free to adapt and extend this project to explore other authors or enhance the recommendation system's capabilities.
